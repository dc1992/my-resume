                <div class="aboutme">I'm 31, and I've always been curious about technology in every form. Even today, I'm interested in pretty much everything that is tech-related. I find it stimulating to learn and challenge myself; I always feel like I need to learn more and understand things better. In my free time, I love to walk with my dog and spend time with my girlfriend. I also like going to the gym; it keeps me energized and reminds me that consistency and discipline are the keys to improvement.</div>

In addition to this, I am responsible for overseeing the development of the mobile app and acting as a facilitator between development teams and stakeholders.
